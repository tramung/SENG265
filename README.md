# Test files SENG 265 Spring 2018

The files in this directory consist of pairs. For example:
* in01.txt and out01.txt are a pair
* in02.txt and out02.txt are a pair
* etc.

The idea is that the content of the file-pair's input file should, when
redirected into ./kwic1, result in the same content as can be found in the
output file.

_in14.txt.old & _out14.txt.old are versions of test 14 containing a duplicate
word. The current test14 files do not have that repetition.

For some reason, the in11.txt does not contain "and" in the exclusion words,
yet the "and" in the indexing text does not appear in the indexed output.
Something may have gone awry when preparing the input file. New versions
of files for test 11 are now in place.
